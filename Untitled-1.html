    <p>How has your life changed over the years? What are some of the things<br> that are different now than they were in the past? Write a poem about the<br> process of change, and how it can be both scary and exciting.</p>
</body>I am aware of what awaits me,<br>
But my nerves are quivering high.<br>
Everything around will be changing,<br>
Am I ready to say goodbye?<br>

Am I ready to leave behind,<br>
All I've known from birth to now?<br>
This idea that life's always changing,<br>
Makes me wonder why and how.<br>

I know change can be frightening,<br>
But I wonder could it be.<br>
Could tomorrow be something wonderful,<br>
That will make me so happy?,<br>

I'm done being frightened,<br>
It's time to face the facts.<br>
Moving on to a new chapter,<br>
I will move forward and not look back.<body/>
